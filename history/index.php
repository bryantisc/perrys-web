				<p>For six generations, the Perry family has lived and labored on the property the store now calls home. Through that time there's been much change and growth.
				Originally, the store was the family chicken barn; complete with a grain elevator. Our front counter used to be the horse stable, and there are even 
				gouges in the old timbers where the horses would chew the wood while indoors.
				</p>
				<p>The property looks much different now than it did then, but there's still that lingering spirit of hard work and dedication here.

				Doug &amp; Dotty Perry founded Perry's Furniture and Appliances in 1978. At the time, we carried many major brands, including Flexsteel (a brand we still carry to this day).
				</p>
				<p>Though we no longer carry any appliances, the store's size and scope has grown. What was once approximately 8,000 square feet has expanded to cover over 15,000, housing the greatest <a href="/manufacturers">brands</a>
				and <a href="/new-arrivals">featuring the latest trends.</a></p>

				<p>When Doug &amp; Dotty retired in [year], their daughter, Kimberly, took the reigns and has been leading the business to even greater heights. She has 
				expanded our list of services to include room design and home staging. In 2014 we rebranded the company and became <em>Perry's Home Furnishings &amp; Design</em>. 
				</p>
				<p>However, throughout these many changes there remains one thing that's steadfast. Over the years, the Perrys have &quot;adopted&quot; an extended family of 
				dedicated and talented folks. We all strive to cultivate what Doug &amp; Dotty started in the late '70s; a unique and family-oriented furniture buying experience.
				</p>
				<p>For nearly four decades, Perry's Home Furnishings &amp; Design have been doing things a little differently. Come see what we're doing, and learn how our expertise 
				can help you <em><b>love your home</b></em>.
