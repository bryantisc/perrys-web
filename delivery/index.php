			<h2>Free Removal</h2>
			<p>While we're delivering your new furnishings, we offer complementary removal of unwanted furniture. Sofas, loveseats, occasional tables, beds, 
			mattresses, and more. Gently used items are then donated to local charities.

			<h2>Donation</h2>
			<p>We work with three local charities to get used furniture into the hands of those who need it. Our commitment to our community includes a strong 
			relationship with <a href="http://www.newhopeforwomen.org/">New Hope for Women</a>, <a href="http://homehelphope.org/">Knox County Homeless Coalition</a>, 
			and <a href="http://www.midcoasthabitat.org/">Midcoast Habitat Restore</a>. Gently used items are continually donated, providing comfort in transitional 
			housing situations.
