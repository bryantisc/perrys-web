#Markdown Guide

##Simple Styling
You can **bold** and *italicize*
>`**bold**`
>**bold**
>
>`*italicize*`
>*italicize*

<br>
##Horizonal Rules
You can create a horizontal rule like so:
>```
>Example text
> ******
> More example text
>```
>
> Example text
> ******
> More example text

<br>
##Lists
You can create lists easily
>```
> * Item 1
> * Item 2
>```
>
> * Item 1
> * Item 2
>
>```
> 1. Item 1
> 2. Item 2
> ```
> 1. Item 1
> 2. Item 2

<br>
##Headlines
Creating headlines is easy
>`#Headline 1`
>#Headline 1
>
>`##Headline 2`
>##Headline 2
>

...The more # you add, the smaller the headline becomes. (I believe the limit is four hashmarks)

<br>
##New Lines
If you want to create a new line, make sure that your lines are separated like this:
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>
This is one line of text<br>

This is another line of text
</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

**NOTE:** Without an empty line between them, there won't be a new line created.

<br>
##Links
Create a link by encapsulating text like this:
<blockquote><p><code>If you're looking for a link, [look no further](http://perryshomedesign.com)</code></p>
If you're looking for a link, <a href="http://perryshomedesign.com">look no further</a>.
<p></p>
</blockquote>

<br>
##Images
You can include an image like this:
>`![Give the image a name](http://example.com/image.jpg)`

It looks very similar to a link. The difference being the "**!**"

You can also reference relative paths (as in images on our server).
>`![Perry's Logo](/res/logo-black.svg)`
>![Perry's Logo](/res/logo-black.svg)

<br>
##HTML Elements
You can use HTML elements in your markdown, but note that actual markdown styling won't be applied to elements within HTML tags. Example:

>```
>*This text IS italic*
><div>*This text IS NOT italic because it's in a <div> tag*</div>
><br>
>**This text is bold**
><p>**This text IS NOT bold because it's in a <p> tag**</p>
>```
>*This text IS italic*
><div>*This text IS NOT italic because it's in a &lt;div&gt; tag*</div>
><br>
>**This text is bold**
><p>**This text IS NOT bold because it's in a &lt;p&gt; tag**</p>

<br>
##Call to Action
If you want to create a call to action button, it *must be the very last item in a document*. It works like every other link, except it's the **LAST** line:

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>
[Call to action button](http://perryshomedesign.com)
</code>
<a href="http://perryshomedesign.com" style="text-align:center;">Call to action button</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
