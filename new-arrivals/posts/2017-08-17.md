##Locally sourced. Locally made.

We just added a few one-of-a-kind architectural pieces to our showroom. They are windows and doors reclaimed from structures *throughout New England*. And now, they have been transformed into gorgeous mirrors. They're one-off pieces made by a local craftsman so once they've sold, **they're gone for good.**
